📚 **Documentation**: See [MCP_SETUP.md](./MCP_SETUP.md) for detailed setup and usage.

### Specialized AI Agents (6 Configured)

Work with specialized agents for different aspects of development:

1. **content-creator** - AI content strategist for blog posts and case studies
2. **developer** - Full-stack Next.js specialist
3. **qa-tester** - Quality assurance and testing expert

## Adding New Components

To add a new shadcn UI component:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add [component-name]
```

## Performance Considerations

- The site uses Next.js Image component for optimized image loading
- Components are split into smaller chunks for better code-splitting
- Animation is handled efficiently with Framer Motion

## SEO

- The site includes proper meta tags and structured data for SEO
- Each page has its own meta description and title
- JSON-LD schema is implemented for rich results in search engines
